<h2>Epitaphs on Tradesmen.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Many</span> interesting epitaphs have been placed to the memory of tradesmen.
Often they are not of an elevating character, nor highly poetical, but
they display the whims and oddities of men. We will first present a few
relating to the watch and clock-making trade. The first specimen is from
Lydford churchyard, on the borders of Dartmoor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Here lies, in horizontal position,<br />
the outside case of<br />
<span class="smcap">George Routleigh</span>, Watchmaker;<br />
Whose abilities in that line were an honour<br />
to his profession.<br />
Integrity was the Mainspring, and prudence the<br />
Regulator,<br />
of all the actions of his life.<br />
Humane, generous, and liberal,<br />
his Hand never stopped<br />
till he had relieved distress.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>So nicely regulated were all his motions,<br />
that he never went wrong,<br />
except when set a-going<br />
by people<br />
who did not know his Key;<br />
even then he was easily<br />
set right again.<br />
He had the art of disposing his time so well,<br />
that his hours glided away<br />
in one continual round<br />
of pleasure and delight,<br />
until an unlucky minute put a period to<br />
his existence.<br />
He departed this life<br />
Nov. 14, 1802,<br />
aged 57:<br />
wound up,<br />
in hopes of being taken in hand<br />
by his Maker;<br />
and of being thoroughly cleaned, repaired,<br />
and set a-going<br />
in the world to come.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of Uttoxeter, a monument is placed to the memory of
Joseph Slater, who died November 21st, 1822, aged 49 years:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Here lies one who strove to equal time,<br />
A task too hard, each power too sublime;<br />
Time stopt his motion, o&#8217;erthrew his balance-wheel,<br />
Wore off his pivots, tho&#8217; made of hardened steel;<br />
Broke all his springs, the verge of life decayed,<br />
And now he is as though he&#8217;d ne&#8217;er been made.<br />
Such frail machine till time&#8217;s no more shall rust,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>And the archangel wakes our sleeping dust;<br />
Then in assembled worlds in glory join,<br />
And sing&mdash;&#8220;The hand that made us is divine.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>Our next is from Berkeley, Gloucestershire:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Here lyeth <span class="smcap">Thomas Peirce</span>, whom no man taught,<br />
Yet he in iron, brass, and silver wrought;<br />

Of Berkeley, five times Mayor this artist was,<br />
And yet this Mayor, this artist, was but grass.<br />
When his own watch was down on the last day,<br />
He that made watches had not made a key<br />
To wind it up; but useless it must lie,<br />
Until he rise again no more to die.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Died February 25th, 1665, aged 77.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>The following is from Bolsover churchyard, Derbyshire:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Here<br />
lies, in a horizontal position, the outside<br />
case of<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Hinde</span>,<br />
Clock and Watch-maker,<br />
Who departed this life, wound up in hope of<br />
being taken in hand by his Maker, and being<br />
thoroughly cleaned, repaired, and set a-going<br />
in the world to come,<br />
On the 15th of August, 1836,<br />
In the 19th year of his age.</p>

<p>Respecting the next example, Mr. Edward Walford, <span class="smcaplc">M.A.</span>, wrote to the
<i>Times</i> as follows: Close to the south-western corner of the parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
churchyard of Hampstead there has long stood a square tomb, with a
scarcely decipherable inscription, to the memory of a man of science of
the last century, whose name is connected with the history of practical
navigation. The tomb, having stood there for more than a century, had
become somewhat dilapidated, and has lately undergone a careful
restoration at the cost and under the supervision of the Company of
Clock-makers, and the fact is recorded in large characters on the upper
face. The tops of the upright iron railings which surround the tomb have
been gilt, and the restored inscription runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In memory of Mr. <span class="smcap">John Harrison</span>, late of Red Lion-square, London,
inventor of the time-keeper for ascertaining the longitude at sea. He
was born at Foulby, in the county of York, and was the son of a
builder of that place, who brought him up to the same profession.
Before he attained the age of 21, he, without any instruction,
employed himself in cleaning and repairing clocks and watches, and
made a few of the former, chiefly of wood. At the age of 25 he
employed his whole time in chronometrical improvements. He was the
inventor of the gridiron pendulum, and the method of preventing the
effects of heat and cold upon time-keepers by two bars fixed together;
he introduced the secondary spring, to keep them going while winding
up, and was the inventor of most (or all) the improvements in clocks
and watches during his time. In the year 1735 his first time keeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>was sent to Lisbon, and in 1764 his then much improved fourth
time-keeper having been sent to Barbadoes, the Commissioners of
Longitude certified that he had determined the longitude within
one-third of half a degree of a great circle, having not erred more
than forty seconds in time. After sixty years&#8217; close application to
the above pursuits, he departed this life on the 24th day of March,
1776, aged 83.</p></div>

<p>In an epitaph in High Wycombe churchyard, life is compared to the working
of a clock. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Of no distemper,<br />
Of no blast he died,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But fell,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Even wondered at</span><br />
Because he dropt not sooner.<br />
Providence seemed to wind him up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">For fourscore years,</span><br />
Yet ran he nine winters more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Till, like a clock,</span><br />
Worn out with repeating time,<br />
The wheels of weary life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">At last stood still.</span><br />
In Memory of <span class="smcap">John Abdidge</span>, Alderman.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Died 1785.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>We have some curious specimens of engineers&#8217; epitaphs. A good example is
copied from the churchyard of Bridgeford-on-the-Hill, Notts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Sacred to the memory
of <span class="smcap">John Walker</span>, the only son of Benjamin and Ann
Walker, Engineer and Pallisade Maker, died September 22nd, 1832, aged
36 years.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

My glass is run, my work is done,<br />
And now my head lies quiet here.<br />
That many an engine I&#8217;ve set up,<br />
And got great praise from men,<br />
I made them work on British ground,<br />
And on the roaring seas;<br />
My engine&#8217;s stopp&#8217;d, my valves are bad,<br />
And lie so deep within;<br />
No engineer could there be found<br />
To put me new ones in.<br />
But Jesus Christ converted me<br />
And took me up above,<br />
I hope once more to meet once more,<br />
And sing redeeming love.</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>Our next is on a railway engine-driver, who died in 1840, and was buried
in Bromsgrove churchyard:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>My engine now is cold and still,<br />

My whistle, too, has lost its tone,<br />
Its shrill and thrilling sounds are gone;<br />

In death I&#8217;m stopped, and rest at last.<br />
Farewell, dear friends, and cease to weep:<br />
In Christ I&#8217;m safe; in Him I sleep.</td></tr></table>

<p>In the Ludlow churchyard is a headstone to the memory of John Abingdon
&#8220;who for forty years drove the Ludlow stage to London, a trusty servant, a
careful driver, and an honest man.&#8221; He died in 1817, and his epitaph is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here his journey ends.</span><br />
Death locked his wheels and gave him rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never more to move,</span><br />
Till Christ shall call him with the blest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To heavenly realms above.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>The epitaph we next give is on the driver of the coach that ran between
Aylesbury and London, by the Rev. H. Bullen, Vicar of Dunton, Bucks, in
whose churchyard the man was buried:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span class="smcap">Parker</span>, farewell! thy journey now is ended,<br />

<p>Lord Byron wrote on John Adams, carrier, of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, an
epitaph as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span class="smcap">John Adams</span> lies here, of the parish of Southwell,<br />

For the liquor he drank, being too much for one,<br />
He could not carry off&mdash;so he&#8217;s now carri-on.</td></tr></table>

<p>On Hobson, the famous University carrier, the following lines were
written:&mdash;</p>

&#8217;Twas such a shifter, that, if truth were known,<br />
Death was half glad when he had got him down;<br />
For he had any time these ten years full,<br />
Dodged with him betwixt Cambridge and the Bull;<br />
And surely Death could never have prevailed,<br />
Had not his weekly course of carriage failed.<br />
But lately finding him so long at home,<br />
And thinking now his journey&#8217;s end was come,<br />
And that he had ta&#8217;en up his latest inn,<br />
In the kind office of a chamberlain<br />

<p>In Trinity churchyard, Sheffield, formerly might be seen an epitaph on a
bookseller, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

For riches follow&#8217;d in her train.<br />

<p>The well-known blacksmith&#8217;s epitaph, said to be written by the poet
Hayley, may be found in many churchyards in this country. It formed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
subject of a sermon delivered on Sunday, the 27th day of August, 1837, by
the then Vicar of Crich, Derbyshire, to a large assembly. We are told that
the vicar appeared much excited, and read the prayers in a hurried manner.
Without leaving the desk, he proceeded to address his flock for the last
time; and the following is the substance thereof: &#8220;To-morrow, my friends,
this living will be vacant, and if any one of you is desirous of becoming
my successor he has now an opportunity. Let him use his influence, and who
can tell but he may be honoured with the title of Vicar of Crich. As this
is my last address, I shall only say, had I been a blacksmith, or a son of
Vulcan, the following lines might not have been inappropriate:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>My sledge and hammer lie reclined,<br />
My bellows, too, have lost their wind;<br />
My fire&#8217;s extinct, my forge decayed,<br />
And in the dust my vice is laid.<br />
My coal is spent, my iron&#8217;s gone,<br />
My nails are drove, my work is done;<br />
My fire-dried corpse lies here at rest,<br />
And, smoke-like, soars up to be bless&#8217;d.</td></tr></table>

<p>If you expect anything more, you are deceived; for I shall only say,
Friends, farewell, farewell!&#8221; The effect of this address was too visible
to pass unnoticed. Some appeared as if awakened from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> fearful dream,
and gazed at each other in silent astonishment; others for whom it was too
powerful for their risible nerves to resist, burst into boisterous
laughter, while one and all slowly retired from the scene, to exercise
their future cogitations on the farewell discourse of their late pastor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>It has been truthfully said that the life of Benjamin Franklin is stranger
than fiction. He was a self-made man, gaining distinction as a printer,
journalist, author, electrician, natural philosopher, statesman, and
diplomatist. The &#8220;Autobiography and Letters of Benjamin Franklin&#8221; has been
extensively circulated, and must ever remain a popular book; young men and
women cannot fail to peruse its pages without pleasure and profit.</p>

<p>In collections of epitaphs and books devoted to literary curiosities, a
quaint epitaph said to have been written by Franklin frequently finds a
place. He was not, however, the original composer of the epitaph, but
imitated it for himself. Jacob Tonson, a famous bookseller, died in 1735,
and a Latin epitaph was written on him by an Eton scholar. It is printed
in the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>, February, 1736, with a diffuse paraphrase
in English verse. The following is at all events a conciser version:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">The volume<br />
of<br />
his life being finished<br />
here is the end of<br />
<span class="smcap">Jacob Tonson</span>.<br />
Weep authors and break your pens;<br />

but print the last inscription on the title<br />

the Editor should want a title:<br />
Here lies a bookseller,<br />
The leaf of his life being finished,<br />
Awaiting a new edition,<br />
Augmented and corrected.</p>

<p>The following is Franklin&#8217;s epitaph for himself:</p>

<p class="center">The body<br />
of<br />
<span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>,<br />
Printer<br />
(Like the cover of an old book,<br />
its contents torn out,<br />
And stript of its lettering and gilding),<br />
Lies here, food for worms.<br />
But the work itself shall not be lost,<br />
For it will, as he believed, appear once more,<br />
In a new and more elegant edition,<br />
Revised and corrected<br />
By<br />
The Author.</p>

<p>But it is not at all certain that Franklin was not the earlier writer, for
the epitaph was certainly a production of the first years of
manhood&mdash;probably 1727. There are other epitaphs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> which he may have
taken the idea; that, on the famous John Cotton at Boston, for instance,

<p>There is a similar conceit in the epitaph on John Foster, the Boston
printer. Franklin would probably have seen both of these.</p>

<p>On the 17th April, 1790, at the age of eighty-four years, passed away the
sturdy patriot and sagacious writer. His mortal remains rest with those of
his wife in the burial-ground of Christ Church, Philadelphia. A plain flat
stone covers the grave, bearing the following simple inscription:&mdash;</p>

his tomb. We give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> picture of the quiet corner where the good man and

<p>In the churchyard of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, is a good specimen of a
typographical epitaph, placed in remembrance of a noted printer, who died
in the year 1818. It reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Here lie the remains of <span class="smcap">L. Gedge</span>, Printer.<br />

<p>The next specimen is less satisfactory, because devoid of the hope that
should encircle the death of the Christian. It is the epitaph which
Baskerville, the celebrated Birmingham printer and type founder, directed
to be placed upon a tomb of masonry in the shape of a cone, and erected
over his remains:&mdash;</p>

wicked arts of priestcraft.</p>

<p>It is recorded that &#8220;The tomb has long since been overturned, and even the
remains of the man himself desecrated and dispersed till the final day of
resurrection, when the atheism which in his later years he professed will
receive assuredly so complete and overwhelming a refutation.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1599 died Christopher Barker, one of the most celebrated of the

<p>When George III. was king, Jenny Gaskoin taught a Dames&#8217; School at Great
Limber, a rural Lincolnshire village. From the stories respecting her
which have come down to us it would appear that her qualifications for the
position of teacher were somewhat limited. It is related that in the
children&#8217;s reading lessons words often occurred which the good lady was
unable to pronounce or explain. She was too politic, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>however, to confess
her ignorance on such occasions, and had resource to the artful evasion of
saying, &#8220;Never mind it, bairns; it is a bad word; skip it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dame Gaskoin had a son who obtained the situation of a &#8220;helper&#8221; in the
royal stables. For a slight offence the youth was whipped by the Prince of
Wales, when in a momentary fit of anger. It would appear that the Prince
regretted his conduct, for he promoted the boy to give him redress for the
dressing he had bestowed. Young Gaskoin had the good fortune to be able to
introduce his sister Mary into the service of the princesses. By exemplary
conduct she obtained the esteem of the royal family. The maiden on one
occasion ventured to observe that the rye-bread of Lincolnshire, such as
her mother made, was far superior to that which was used at court. This
caused the request to be made, or rather a command given, that some of the
aforesaid bread should be forwarded as a specimen. The order was complied
with, and gave complete satisfaction. The good schoolmistress was
afterwards desired to send periodically up to town bread for the royal
table.</p>

<p>During a visit to the metropolis to see her daughter the old lady had the
honour of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> interview with the princesses. She wore a mob cap of simple
form, which took the fancy of the royal ladies to such a degree that it
was introduced at court under the name of &#8220;Gaskoin Mob-Cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have little to add, save that the daughter remained in the royal
service, attending especially upon the person of the Princess Amelia, and
the labour and anxiety she underwent in ministering to the princess in her
last illness, combined with sorrow for her death, caused her to follow her
royal mistress to the grave after a short interval. In the cloisters of
St. George&#8217;s Chapel, Windsor, is a memorial creditable to the monarch who
erected it, and the humble handmaid whom it commemorates:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many visitors to Morecambe pay a pilgrimage to Sambo&#8217;s grave. A
correspondent kindly furnishes us with the following particulars of poor
Sambo, who is buried far from his native land. Sunderland Point, he says,
a village on the coast near Lancaster, was, before the advent of
Liverpool, the port for Lancaster, and is credited with having received
the first cargo of West India cotton which reached this country. Some
rather large warehouses were built there about a century ago, now adapted
to fishermen&#8217;s cottages for the few fisher folk who still linger about the
little port. Near the ferry landing on the Morecambe side there is a
strange looking tree, which tradition says was raised from a seed brought
from the West Indies, and the natives call it the cotton tree, because
every year it strews the ground with its white blossoms. Close to the
shore, with only a low stone wall dividing it from the restless sea, is a
solitary grave in the corner of a field, which is called &#8220;Sambo&#8217;s grave.&#8221;
Poor Sambo came over to this country with a cotton cargo, fell ill at
Sunderland Point, and died; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> there being no churchyard near, he was
laid in mother earth in an adjoining field. The house is still pointed out
in which the negro died, and some sixty years afterwards it occurred to
Mr. James Watson that the fact of this dark-skinned brother dying so far
from home among strangers was sufficiently pathetic to warrant a memorial.
Accordingly he caused the following to be inscribed on a large stone laid
flat on the grave, which indicates that he was a slave of probably an
English master about a century before the days of negro emancipation in
the colonies:&mdash;</p>

years he enlisted into His Majesty&#8217;s service under Sir George Rooke,
and was at the taking of the Fortress of Gibralter in 1704. He
afterwards served under the Duke of Marlborough at Ramillies, fought
on the 23rd of May, 1706, where he was wounded by a musket-shot in his
thigh. Afterwards returned to his native country, and with manly
courage defended his sovereign&#8217;s rights in the Rebellion in 1715 and
1745. He died within the space of 150 yards of where he was born, and
was interred here the 30th January, 1791, aged 112 years.</p>

<p>On one of the buttresses on the south side of St. Mary&#8217;s Church, at
Beverley, is an oval tablet, to commemorate the fate of two Danish
soldiers, who, during their voyage to Hull, to join the service of the
Prince of Orange, in 1689, quarrelled, and having been marched with the
troops to Beverley, during their short stay there sought a private meeting
to settle their differences by the sword. Their melancholy end is recorded
in a doggerel epitaph, of which we give an illustration.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mode of execution was,&#8221; writes the Rev. Jno. Pickford, <span class="smcaplc">M.A.</span>, &#8220;it may

has particularly described in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> &#8216;Anne of Geierstein,&#8217; as used at the
decapitation of Sir Archibald de Hagenbach, and which the executioner is
described as wielding with such address and skill. The Danish culprit was,
like the oppressive knight, probably bound and seated in a chair; but such
swords as those depicted on the tablet could not well have been used for
the purpose, for they are long, narrow in the blade, and perfectly
straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have in the diary of Abraham de la Pryme, the Yorkshire antiquary, some
very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> particulars respecting the Danes. Writing in 1689, the
diarist tells us: &#8220;Towards the latter end of the aforegoing year, there
landed at Hull about six or seven thousand Danes, all stout fine men, the
best equip&#8217;d and disciplin&#8217;d of any that was ever seen. They were mighty
godly and religious. You would seldom or never hear an oath or ugly word
come out of their mouths. They had a great many ministers amongst them,
whome they call&#8217;d pastours, and every Sunday almost, ith&#8217; afternoon, they
prayed and preach&#8217;d as soon as our prayers was done. They sung almost all
their divine service, and every ministre had those that made up a quire
whom the rest follow&#8217;d. Then there was a sermon of about half-an-houre&#8217;s
length, all <i>memoratim</i>, and then the congregation broke up. When they
administered the sacrament, the ministre goes into the church and caused
notice to be given thereof, then all come before, and he examined them one
by one whether they were worthy to receive or no. If they were he admitted
them, if they were not he writ their names down in a book, and bid them
prepare against the next Sunday. Instead of bread in the sacrament, I
observed that they used wafers about the bigness and thickness of a
sixpence. They held it no sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> to play at cards upon Sundays, and commonly
did everywhere where they were suffered; for indeed in many places the
people would not abide the same, but took the cards from them. Tho&#8217; they
loved strong drink, yet all the while I was amongst them, which was all
this winter, I never saw above five or six of them drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The diarist tells us that the strangers liked this country. It appears
they worked for the farmers, and sold tumblers, cups, spoons, etc., which
they had imported, to the English. They acted in the courthouse a play in
their own language, and realised a good sum of money by their
performances. The design of the piece was &#8220;Herod&#8217;s Tyranny&mdash;The Birth of
Christ&mdash;The Coming of the Wise Men.&#8221;</p>

<p>A correspondent states that in Battersea Church there is a handsome
monument to Sir Edward Wynter, a captain in the East India Company&#8217;s
service in the reign of Charles II., which records that in India, where he
had passed many years of his life, he was</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>The stirring lives of many female soldiers have furnished facts for
several important historical works, and rich materials for the writers of
romance. We give an illustration of the stone erected by public
subscription in Brighton churchyard over the remains of a notable female
warrior, named Ph&oelig;be Hessel. The inscription tells the story of her
long and eventful career. The closing years of her life were cheered by
the liberality of George IV. During a visit to Brighton, when he was
Prince Regent, he met old Ph&oelig;be, and was greatly interested in her
history. He ascertained that she was supported by a few benevolent
townsmen, and the kind-hearted Prince questioned her respecting the amount
that would be required to enable her to pass the remainder of her days in
comfort. &#8220;Half-a-guinea a week,&#8221; said Ph&oelig;be Hessel, &#8220;will make me as
happy as a princess.&#8221; That amount by order of her royal benefactor was
paid to her until the day of her death. She told capital stories, had an
excellent memory, and was in every respect most agreeable company. Her
faculties remained unimpaired to within a few hours of her death. On
September 22nd, 1821, she was visited by a person of some literary taste,
and the following particulars were obtained respecting her life. The
writer states:&mdash;&#8220;I have seen to-day an extraordinary character in the
person of Ph&oelig;be Hessel, a poor woman stated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> be 108 years of age. It
appears that she was born in March, 1715, and at fifteen formed a strong
attachment to Samuel Golding, a private in the regiment called Kirk&#8217;s
Lambs, which was ordered to the West Indies. She determined to follow her
lover, enlisted into the 5th regiment of foot, commanded by General
Pearce, and embarked after him. She served there five years without
discovering herself to anyone. At length they were ordered to Gibraltar.
She was likewise at Montserrat, and would have been in action, but her
regiment did not reach the place till the battle was decided. Her lover
was wounded at Gibraltar and sent to Plymouth; she then waited on the
General&#8217;s lady at Gibraltar, disclosed her sex, told her story, and was
immediately sent home. On her arrival, Ph&oelig;be went to Samuel Golding in
the hospital, nursed him there, and when he came out, married and lived
with him for twenty years; he had a pension from Chelsea. After Golding&#8217;s
death, she married Hessel, has had many children, and has been many years
a widow. Her eldest son was a sailor with Admiral Norris; he afterwards
went to the East Indies, and, if he is now alive, must be nearly seventy
years of age. The rest of the family are dead. At an advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> age she
earned a scanty livelihood at Brighton by selling apples and gingerbread
on the Marine Parade.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw this woman to-day in her bed, to which she is confined from having
lost the use of her limbs. She has even now, old and withered as she is, a
characteristic countenance, and, I should judge from her present
appearance, must have had a fine, though perhaps a masculine style of head
when young. I have seen many a woman at the age of sixty or seventy look
older than she does under the load of 108 years of human life. Her cheeks
are round and seem firm, though ploughed with many a small wrinkle. Her
eyes, though their sight is gone, are large and well formed. As soon as it
was announced that somebody had come to see her, she broke the silence of
her solitary thoughts and spoke. She began in a complaining tone, as if
the remains of a strong and restless spirit were impatient of the prison
of a decaying and weak body. &#8216;Other people die, and I cannot,&#8217; she said.
Upon exciting her recollection of former days, her energy seemed roused,
and she spoke with emphasis. Her voice was strong for an old person; and I
could easily believe her when, upon being asked if her sex was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> not in
danger of being detected by her voice, she replied that she always had a
strong and manly voice. She appeared to take a pride in having kept her
secret, declaring that she told it to no man, woman, or child, during the
time she was in the army; &#8216;for you know, Sir, a drunken man and a child
always tell the truth. But,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I told my secret to the ground. I
dug a hole that would hold a gallon, and whispered it there.&#8217; While I was
with her, the flies annoyed her extremely; she drove them away with a fan,
and said they seemed to smell her out as one that was going to the grave.
She showed me a wound she had received in her elbow by a bayonet. She
lamented the error of her former ways, but excused it by saying, &#8216;When you
are at Rome, you must do as Rome does.&#8217; When she could not distinctly hear
what was said, she raised herself in the bed and thrust her head forward
with impatient energy. She said when the king saw her, he called her &#8216;a
jolly old fellow.&#8217; Though blind, she could discern a glimmering light, and
I was told would frequently state the time of day by the effect of light.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Necropolis, Glasgow, is a monument representing the stage and
proscenium of a theatre, placed to the memory of John Henry Alexander, of
the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. He was a native of Dunse, Berwickshire, and
was born July 31st, 1796. At an early age, says Dr. Rogers, his parents
removed to Glasgow, where, in his thirteenth year, he was apprenticed to a
hosier. With a remarkable taste for mimicry he practised private
theatricals; and having attracted the notice of the managers of Queen
Street Theatre, he obtained an opportunity of publicly exhibiting his
gifts. In his sixteenth year he adopted the histrionic profession. For
some seasons he was employed in a theatre at Newcastle; he subsequently
performed at Carlisle, and afterwards in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. At
Edinburgh his successful impersonations of Dandie Dinmont and other
characters of the Waverley novels gained him the friendship of Sir Walter
Scott. After some changes he accepted the managership of the Dunlop Street
Theatre, Glasgow, of which he became proprietor in 1829. He rebuilt the
structure in 1840; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> was partially destroyed by fire on the 17th
February, 1849, when sixty-five persons unhappily perished. The shock
which he experienced on this occasion seriously affected his health, and
in 1851 he found it expedient to retire from his profession. He died on
the 15th December, 1851, aged fifty-five. On his tombstone are inscribed
these lines from the pen of Mr. James Hedderwick, the editor of the
<i>Glasgow Citizen</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>In many collections of epitaphs the following is stated to be inscribed on

<p>The next epitaph was written by Swift on Dicky Pearce, who died 1728, aged

<p>Joe Miller, of facetious memory, next claims our attention. We find it
stated in Chambers&#8217;s &#8220;Book of Days&#8221; (issued 1869) as follows: Miller was
interred in the burial-ground of the parish of St. Clement Danes, in
Portugal Street, where a tombstone was erected to his memory. About ten
years ago that burial-ground, by the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> of the mortuary remains, and
the demolition of the monuments, was converted into a site for King&#8217;s
College Hospital. Whilst this not unnecessary, yet undesirable,
desecration was in progress, the writer saw Joe&#8217;s tombstone lying on the
ground; and being told that it would be broken up and used as materials
for the new building, he took an exact copy of the inscription, which was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>An interesting sketch of the life of Joe Miller will be found in the &#8220;Book
of Days,&#8221; vol. ii., page 216, and in the same informing and entertaining
work, the following notes are given respecting the writer of the foregoing
epitaph: &#8220;The &#8216;S. Duck,&#8217; whose name figures as author of the verses on
Miller&#8217;s tombstone, and who is alluded to on the same tablet, by Mr.
Churchwarden Buck, as an instance of &#8216;poetic talent in humble life,&#8217;
deserves a short notice. He was a thresher in the service of a farmer near
Kew, in Surrey. Imbued with an eager desire for learning, he, under most
adverse circumstances, managed to obtain a few books, and educate himself
to a limited degree. Becoming known as a rustic rhymer, he attracted the
attention of Caroline, queen of George II., who, with her accustomed
liberality, settled on him a pension of &pound;30 per annum; she made him a
Yeoman of the Guard, and installed him as keeper of a kind of museum she
had in Richmond Park, called Merlin&#8217;s Cave. Not content with these
promotions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> the generous, but perhaps inconsiderate, queen caused Duck to
be admitted to holy orders, and preferred to the living of Byfleet, in
Surrey, where he became a popular preacher among the lower classes,
chiefly through the novelty of being the &#8216;Thresher Parson.&#8217; This gave
Swift occasion to write the following quibbling epigram:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>The thresher Duck could o&#8217;er the queen prevail;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>The proverb says,&mdash;&#8220;No fence against a flail.&#8221;<br />
From threshing corn, he turns to thresh his brains,<br />
For which her Majesty allows him grains;<br />
Though &#8217;tis confest, that those who ever saw<br />
His poems, think &#8217;em all not worth a straw.<br />
Thrice happy Duck! employed in threshing stubble!<br />
Thy toil is lessened, and thy profits double.</td></tr></table>

<p class="caption">JOE MILLER&#8217;S TOMBSTONE, ST. CLEMENT DANES CHURCHYARD, LONDON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would suppose the poor thresher to have been beneath Swift&#8217;s notice,
but the provocation was great, and the chastisement, such as it was,
merited. For though few men had ever less pretensions to poetical genius
than Duck, yet the Court party actually set him up as a rival&mdash;nay, as
superior&mdash;to Pope. And the saddest part of the affair was that Duck, in
his utter simplicity and ignorance of what really constituted poetry, was
led to fancy himself the greatest poet of the age. Consequently,
considering that his genius was neglected, and that he was not rewarded
according to his poetical deserts by being made the clergyman of an
obscure village, he fell into a state of melancholy, which ended in
suicide; affording another to the numerous instances of the very great
difficulty of doing good. If the well-meaning queen had elevated Duck to
the position of farm-bailiff, he might have led a long and happy life,
amongst the scenes and the classes of society in which his youth had
passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> and thus been spared the pangs of disappointed vanity and
misdirected ambition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Says a thoughtful writer, if truth, perspicuity, wit, gravity, and every
property pertaining to the ancient or modern epitaph, were ever united in
one of terse brevity, it was that made for Burbage, the tragedian, in the
days of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p>We next present particulars of a celebrated deer-stealer. According to a
notice furnished in the &#8220;Nottingham Date Book,&#8221; the deeds of Tom Booth
were for many years after his death a never-failing subject of
conversational interest in Nottingham. It is stated that no modern
deer-stealer was anything like so popular. Thorsby relates one exploit as
follows:&mdash;&#8220;In Nottingham Park, at one time, was a favourite fine deer, a
chief ranger, on which Tom and his wily companions had often cast their
eyes; but how to deceive the keeper while they killed it was a task of
difficulty. The night, however, in which they accomplished their
purpose&mdash;whether by any settled plan or not is not known&mdash;they found the
keeper at watch, as usual, in a certain place in the park. One of them,
therefore, went in an opposite direction in the park, and fired his gun to
make the keeper believe he had shot a deer; upon which away goes the
keeper, in haste, to the spot, which was at a very considerable distance
from the place where the favourite deer was, and near which Tom Booth was
skulking. Tom, waiting a proper time, when he thought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> keeper at a
sufficient distance for accomplishing his purpose, fired and killed the
deer, and dragged it through the river Leen undiscovered.&#8221; Booth was a
stout man, and by trade a whitesmith. The stone marking the place of his
interment is still in good preservation, and stands in St. Nicholas&#8217;
burial-ground, against the southern wall of the church. It bears the
following inscription:</p>

<p>Old Tom was so highly pleased with the epitaph, which was written before
his death, that he had it engraved on the stone some months before its
services were required. In addition to the epitaph itself, the head-stone
was made to include Booth&#8217;s name, etc., and also that of his wife, blank
places being left in each case for the age and time of death. Booth&#8217;s
compartment of the stone was in due course properly filled up; but the
widow, disliking the exhibition of her name on a tombstone while living,
resolved that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> such stone should never indicate her resting-place when
dead; she accordingly left an injunction that her body be interred
elsewhere, and the inscription is incomplete to this day.</p>

<p>Some time before Amos Street, a celebrated Yorkshire huntsman, died, a
stone was obtained, and on it engraved the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<p>Poor &#8220;Old Amos&#8221; passed away on October 3rd, 1777, and was buried in
Birstal churchyard. The foregoing inscription may still be read.</p>

<p>The Rev. R. H. Whitworth tells us: &#8220;There is an old monument in the south
aisle of Blidworth Church, to the memory of Thomas Leake, Esq., who was
killed at Blidworth Rocking, in <span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span> 1598. He may be regarded as the last
of the race who sat in Robin Hood&#8217;s seat, if those restless Forest Chiefs,
typified under that name, can be supposed ever to have sat at all. Leake
held office under the Crown, but was as wild a freebooter as ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> drew
bow. His character is portrayed in his epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<p>The border of this monument is rudely panelled, each panel having some
forest hunting subject in relief. There are hounds getting scent, and a
hound pursuing an antlered stag; a hunting horn, ribboned; plunging and
flaying knives, a crossbow, a forest-bow, two arrows, and two hunters&#8217;
belts with arrows inserted. This is his register&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Leake</span>, esquire, buried the<br />
4th February, 1598.</p>

<p>There is a captivating bit of romance connected with Leake&#8217;s death, which
occurred at Archer&#8217;s Water. Although somewhat &#8216;provectus in &aelig;tate,&#8217; he had
won the affections of the landlady&#8217;s daughter, much to the annoyance of
the mother. Archer&#8217;s Water was on the old driftroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> by Blidworth, from
Edinburgh to London, that by which Jeanie Deans travelled, and over which
Dick Turpin rode. Hundreds of thousands of Scotch cattle went by this way
to town, and there was a difficulty connected with a few of them in which
Leake was concerned, and a price being set upon his head, his
mother-in-law, that was to be, betrayed him to two young soldiers anxious
to secure the reward, one of whom was, in the mother&#8217;s eyes, the more
favoured lover. Tom was always attended by two magnificent dogs, and went
well armed. Thrown off his guard he left his dogs in an outhouse, and
entering the inn laid aside his weapons, when he was set upon and
overpowered, and, like many better men before him, slain. The name of a
Captain Salmond of the now extinct parish or manor of Salterford is
connected with this transaction. The date of the combat is 2nd February,
being the festival of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, with which
the highly interesting and historical observance of Blidworth <i>Rocking</i> is
connected. Within the memory of living men, a baby decked with such
flowers as the season afforded was placed in a cradle and carried about
from house to house by an old man, who received a present on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
occasion. As the church is dedicated to St. Mary in connection with the
Purification, the 2nd of February being the Feast Day, this is probably an
interesting reminiscence of some old species of Miracle Play, or
observance connected with the foundation. Anciently people from all
neighbouring counties used to attend this season. Forest games were
played, and amid the attendant licence and confusion, Leake came to his
last grief. Not only in this church does this Ranger of the Blidworth
Wood, for this was his office, possess a memorial. A large cross was
erected, now standing at Fountain Dale, thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Hoc crucis fragmen<br />

<p>What became of the daughter tradition sayeth not. Doubtless she died, as
Tom Leake&#8217;s intended bride ought, of grief, and was buried under some
grand old oak in Blidworth Forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In &#8220;Chronicles of the Tombs,&#8221; by Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, published in
1857, it is stated respecting the foregoing epitaph: &#8220;Smoke money or
chimney money is now collected at Battle, in Sussex, each householder
paying one penny to the Lord of the Manor. It is also levied upon the
inhabitants of the New Forest, in Hants, for the right of cutting peat and
turf for fuel. And from &#8216;Audley&#8217;s Companion to the Almanac,&#8217; page 76, we
learn that &#8216;anciently, even in England, Whitsun farthings, or smoke
farthings, were a composition for offerings made in the Whitsun week, by
every man who occupied a house with a chimney, to the cathedral of the
diocese in which he lived.&#8217; The late Mr. E. B. Price has observed, in
<i>Notes and Queries</i> (Vol. ii., p. 379), that there is a church at
Northampton, upon which is an inscription recording that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> expense of
repairing it was defrayed by a grant of chimney money for, I believe,
seven years, temp. Charles II.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In bygone times the &#8220;Boar&#8217;s Head&#8221; was a common tavern sign, and this is
not surprising for the animal figures in English history, poetry, romance
and popular pastimes. The most famous inn bearing the title of the &#8220;Boar&#8217;s
Head&#8221; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> that in Eastcheap, London. The earliest mention of this tavern
occurs in the testament of William Warden in the days of Richard II., who
gave &#8220;all that tenement called the Boar&#8217;s Head in Eastcheap to a college
of priests, or chaplain, founded by Sir William Walworth, the Lord Mayor,
in the adjoining church of St. Michael, Crooked Lane.&#8221; It was here that
Prince Hal and &#8220;honest Jack Falstaff&#8221; played their pranks. At the door of
the house until the Great Fire were carved figures of the two worthies. In
the works of Goldsmith will be found a charming chapter called
&#8220;Reflections in the Boar&#8217;s Head Tavern, Eastcheap&#8221;; anyone interested in
this old place should not fail to read it. In his pleasant day-dreams he
forgets the important fact that the original house perished in the Great
Fire. In the Guildhall Library is preserved the stone sign from the old
house, which was pulled down in 1831 to make way for the streets leading
to the new London Bridge. We give a picture of this old-time sign on the
opposite page.</p>

<p>A famous waiter of this tavern was buried in the graveyard of St.
Michael&#8217;s Church, hard by, and a monument of Purbeck stone was placed to
his memory bearing an interesting inscription. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> give a picture of the

<p>The cause of the foregoing curious epitaph is thus explained. Thomas Clay
was a man of intemperate habits, and at the time of his death was indebted
to the village innkeeper, named Adlington, to the amount of twenty pounds.
The publican resolved to seize the body; but the parents of the deceased
carefully kept the door locked until the day appointed for the funeral. As
soon as the door was opened, Adlington rushed into the house, seized the
corpse, and placed it on a form in the open street in front of the
residence of the parents of the departed. Clay&#8217;s friends refused to
discharge the publican&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> account. After the body had been exposed for
several days, Adlington committed it to the ground in a <i>bacon chest</i>.</p>

<p>Respecting the above-mentioned Samuel Roe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> a contributor to the
<i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i> wrote, on February 13th, 1794:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Urban,</p>

<p>&#8220;It was with much concern that I read the epitaph upon Mr. Roe, in your
last volume, p. 1192. Upon a little tour which I made in Derbyshire, in
1789, I met with that worthy and very intelligent man at Bakewell, and, in
the course of my antiquarian researches there, derived no inconsiderable
assistance from his zeal and civility. If he did not possess the learning
of his namesake, your old and valuable correspondent, I will venture to
declare that he was not less influenced by a love and veneration for
antiquity, many proofs of which he had given by his care and attention to
the monuments in the church, which were committed to his charge; for he
united the characters of sexton, clerk, singing-master, will-maker, and
school-master. Finding that I was quite alone, he requested permission to
wait upon me at the inn in the evening, urging, as a reason for this
request, that he must be exceedingly gratified by the conversation of a
gentleman who could read the characters upon the monument of Vernon, the
founder of Haddon House, a treat he had not met with for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> years.
After a very pleasant gossip we parted, but not till my honest friend had,
after some apparent struggle, begged of me to indulge him with my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his careful attention is to be attributed the preservation of the
curious Vernon and other monuments in the church, over which, in some
instances, he placed wooden framework to keep off the rough hands and
rougher knives of the boys and young men of the congregation. He also
watched with special care over the Wendesley tomb, and even took careful
rubbings of the inscriptions.</p>

<p>While speaking of this Mr. Roe, it may be well to put the readers of this
work in possession of an interesting fact in connection with the name of
Roe, or Row. The writer above, in his letter to Mr. Urban, says, &#8220;If he
did not possess the learning of his namesake, your old and valued
correspondent,&#8221; etc. By this he means &#8220;T. Row,&#8221; whose contributions to the
<i>Gent.&#8217;s Mag.</i> were very numerous and interesting. The writer under this
signature was the Rev. Samuel Pegge, rector of Whittington, and the
letters forming this pseudonym were the initials of the words, T[he]
R[ector] O[f] W[hittington].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Philip Roe, who succeeded his father (Samuel Roe) as parish clerk of
Bakewell, was his son by his third wife. He was born in 1763, and
succeeded his father in full parochial honours in 1792, having, we
believe, for some time previously acted as his deputy. He died in 1815,
aged 52 years, and was buried with the other members of the family. The

the time of Henry the Eighth, and were lineally descended from William
FitzOsborne, who, in the twelfth century, had been deprived by Ralph
FitzHerbert of his right to the manor of Bellem, in the parish of
Belbroughton. Often have I stood in the picturesque churchyard of

<p>First amongst notable sextons is the name of Old Scarlett, who died July
2, 1591, at the good old age of ninety-eight, and occupied for a long time
the position of sexton of Peterborough Cathedral. He buried two
generations of his fellow-creatures. A portrait of him, placed at the west
end of that noble church, has perpetuated his fame, and caused him to be
introduced in effigy in various publications. Says a writer in the &#8220;Book
of Days&#8221;: &#8220;And what a lively effigy&mdash;short, stout, hardy, and
self-complacent, perfectly satisfied, and perhaps even proud, of his
profession, and content to be exhibited with all its insignia about him!
Two queens had passed through his hands into that bed which gives a
lasting rest to queens and to peasants alike. An officer of Death, who had
so long defied his principal, could not but have made some impression on
the minds of bishop, dean, prebends, and other magnates of the Cathedral,
and hence, as we may suppose, the erection of this lively portraiture of

Scarlett&#8217;s jacket and trunkhose are of a brownish red, his stockings blue,
his shoes black, tied with blue ribbons, and the soles of his feet red.
The cap upon his head is red, and so also is the ground of the coat

<h2>Punning Epitaphs.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Puns</span> in epitaphs have been very common, and may be found in Greek and
Latin, and still more plentifully in our English compositions. In the
French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and other languages, examples
occur. Empedocles wrote an epitaph containing the paronomasia, or pun, on
a physician named Pausanias, and it has by Merivale been happily
translated:&mdash;</p>

<h2>Manxland Epitaphs.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Several</span> of the churchyards in the Isle of Man contain monuments of more
than local interest, and will repay a careful inspection. The ancient
graveyard of Kirk Braddan, surrounded with beautiful trees, and situated
in a secluded spot not far distant from the busy town of Douglas, is the
most celebrated. It not only contains numerous modern tombstones of
unusual interest, but some Runic monuments of importance which have given
rise to some strange stories, and suggested a theme for the poet and a
study for the antiquary.</p>

<p>An old time-worn stone near the chief door of the church attracts much
attention. It states:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here underlyeth ye body of ye Reverend Mr. <span class="smcap">Patrick Thompson</span>, minister
of God&#8217;s word forty years, at present Vicar of Kirk Braddan. Aged 67
anno 1678. Deceased ye 24th of April 1689.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that the stone was prepared eleven
years prior to the death of the vicar.</p>

<p>Some of the gravestones bear records of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> longevity, the most important
being the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In memory of <span class="smcap">Patrick M&#8217;Carrey</span> of Douglas, who departed this life the
9th December 1851, aged 102 years; also in memory of <span class="smcap">Jane M&#8217;Carrey</span>,
alias Leech, wife of the above-named <span class="smcap">Patrick M&#8217;Carrey</span>, who departed
this life the 19th December 1851, aged 100 years. They lived together
upwards of 70 years.</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that although the pair had lived together as man and
wife for three score years and ten, the widow only lived ten days after
the death of her husband. On many of the tombstones the maiden name of the
wife is given, and preceding it is the word <i>alias</i>.</p>

<p>Major Wilks, on his retirement from the Governorship of St. Helena, where
he had the charge of the Emperor Napoleon, settled in the Isle of Man. He
brought with him a black servant, who died a few years after leaving his
native country. He was buried in this graveyard, and over his remains
Major Wilks erected a stone bearing an inscription as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Samuel Alley</span>,</span><br />

Master to the memory of a faithful<br />
Servant, who repaid the boon of<br />
Liberty with unbounded attachment.</td></tr></table>

<p>Governor Wilks was a gentleman of high character, personable and
courtier-like manners. He was a writer of some ability, and was the author
of a &#8220;History of the Mahratta War,&#8221; which Napoleon read and admired. The
ex-Emperor greatly esteemed the Governor, and his departure from St.
Helena, where it is said that he made many wise and lasting improvements,
was much regretted. Shortly prior to leaving the island, Governor Wilks
introduced his daughter to Napoleon, who, it is reported, looked at her
with a pleasing smile and said, &#8220;I have long heard from various quarters
of the superior elegance and beauty of Miss Wilks; but now I am convinced
from my own eyes that report has scarcely done her sufficient justice,&#8221;
and concluded by most politely bowing to Miss Wilks. In course of
conversation he said, &#8220;You will be very glad to leave this island.&#8221; She
replied &#8220;Oh no, sire; I am very sorry to go away.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Mademoiselle, I
wish I could change places with you.&#8221; He presented her with a bracelet in
memory of her visit. She subsequently became Lady Buchan, and died in May,
1888, at the advanced age of ninety-one years; and at the time of her
death it was stated that &#8220;she was one of the last surviving persons who
had a distinct recollection of the first Napoleon.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a curious bit of lore connected with the estate of Governor Wilks
in the Isle of Man; it is situated not far from Kirk Braddan, and called
Kirby, a name corrupted from two Manx words, &#8220;Cur Bee,&#8221; meaning &#8220;Give
food.&#8221; In the olden days the owner of the estate had to provide bed and
board to the Bishop on his journey to and from England, and from this
circumstance is derived its name.</p>

<p>In the churchyard rest the mortal remains of the brother of Mrs. William
Wordsworth, Captain Henry Hutchinson. The poet Wordsworth wrote the
epitaph which appears on his tombstone. The inscription can only be read
with great difficulty, and in a few years will be effaced by the effects
of the weather on the tender stone. The following is a literal copy of the
epitaph, and perhaps the only one which has been printed:&mdash;</p>

At an early age he entered<br />

course of which, being of a<br />
thoughtful mind, he attained<br />
great skill, and knowledge<br />
of his Profession, and endured<br />
in all climates severe<br />
hardships with exemplary<br />
courage &amp; fortitude. The<br />
latter part of his life, was<br />
passed with a beloved Sister<br />
upon this Island. He died at<br />
Douglas the 23rd of May 1839,<br />
much lamented by his Kindred<br />
&amp; Friends who have erected<br />
this stone to testify their<br />
sense of his mild virtues<br />
&amp; humble piety.</p>

<p>Hutchinson wrote poetry of much merit, and one of his sonnets is included
in the works of Wordsworth. It is autobiographical in its character, and
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Inside the church there is another monument of some literary interest,
placed to the memory of the Rev. John Kelly, <span class="smcaplc">LL.D.</span>, <span class="smcaplc">J.P.</span>, etc., Rector of
Copford, near Colchester. He was the compiler of a polyglot dictionary in
the Manx, Gaelic, and Erse languages. The work has quite a romantic
history. We are told, &#8220;whilst conveying the manuscript, on which he had
spent much time and care, to England, he was wrecked between Ramsey and
Whitehaven, but, with great fortitude, he supported himself on the sea,
and held the manuscript at arm&#8217;s-length above the waters for the space of
five hours.&#8221; Several other interesting tablets are inside the church.</p>

<p>There is a striking monument in the churchyard to the memory of Lord Henry
Murray, fifth son of the Duke of Atholl. The inscription states&mdash;&#8220;This
sincere testimonial of affection and deep regret for their commander and
their friend is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> erected by the officers of the regiment.&#8221; He was the
Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the Royal Manx Fencibles, and died in
1805, at the age of thirty-eight years.</p>

<p>In the Kirk Braddan Cemetery, situated not far from the old churchyard, is
buried John Martin, the celebrated artist, and brother of the notorious
Jonathan Martin, who set fire to York Minster, and the eccentric William
Martin, the anti-Newtonian philosopher. Martin painted some remarkable
pictures, and was a man of genius. He was one of the most popular artists
of his day, although he was never a member of the Royal Academy. According
to the local guide-books, &#8220;his latest productions,&mdash;&#8216;The Great Day of His
Wrath,&#8217; &#8216;The Day of Judgment,&#8217; and &#8216;The Plains of Heaven,&#8217;&mdash;owe much of
their atmospheric grandeur and scenery to the residence of the painter on
this island.&#8221; A marble slab on a large square vault bears the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In memory of <span class="smcap">John Martin</span>, historical painter, born at Haydon Bridge,
Northumberland, 19th July 1789, died at Douglas, Isle of Man, 17th

<p>Martin was a man greatly esteemed, and did much to promote intercourse
between men and women devoted to literature, science, and art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Mr. Samuel
Carter Hall, in his pleasant &#8220;Memoirs of Great Men,&#8221; supplies a genial
sketch of this artist. &#8220;Martin, like so many other artists,&#8221; says Mr.
Hall, &#8220;had a terrible wrestle with adversity on his way to fame. I
remember his telling me that once he &#8216;owned&#8217; a shilling; it was needful to
hoard it, but, being very hungry, he entered a baker&#8217;s shop to buy a penny
loaf. To his shame and dismay, he found the shilling was a bad one. &#8216;So
long afterwards,&#8217; added the painter, then at the realisation of his hopes
and aims, &#8216;when I had a shilling, I took care to get it changed into
penny-pieces.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He died on the 26th of April, 1801, in the 93rd year of his age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>A few jottings respecting Metcalf will probably be read with interest. At
the age of six years he lost his sight by an attack of small-pox. Three
years later he joined the boys in their bird-nesting exploits, and climbed
trees to share the plunder. When he had reached thirteen summers he was
taught music, and soon became a proficient performer; he also learned to
ride and swim, and was passionately fond of field-sports. At the age of
manhood it is said his mind possessed a self-dependence rarely enjoyed by
those who have the perfect use of their faculties; his body was well in
harmony with his mind, for when twenty-one years of age he was six feet
one and a half inches in height, strong and robust in proportion. At the
age of twenty-five, he was engaged as a musician at Harrogate. About this
time he was frequently employed during the dark nights as a guide over the
moors and wilds, then abundant in the neighbourhood of Knaresborough. He
was a lover of horse-racing, and often rode his own animals. His horses he
so tamed that when he called them by their respective names they came to
him, thus enabling him to find his own amongst any number and without
trouble. Particulars of the marriage of this individual read like a
romance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> A Miss Benson, the daughter of an innkeeper, reciprocated the
affections of our hero; however, the suitor did not please the parents of
the &#8220;fair lady,&#8221; and they selected a Mr. Dickinson as her future husband.
Metcalf, hearing that the object of his affection was to be married the
following day to the young man selected by her father, hastened to free
her by inducing the damsel to elope with him. Next day they were made man
and wife, to the great surprise of all who knew them, and to the
disappointment of the intended son-in-law. To all it was a matter of
wonder how a handsome woman as any in the country, the pride of the place,
could link her future with &#8220;Blind Jack,&#8221; and, for his sake, reject the
many good offers made her. But the bride set the matter at rest by
declaring: &#8220;His actions are so singular, and his spirit so manly and
enterprising, that I could not help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that he was the first to set up, for the public
accommodation of visitors to Harrogate, a four-wheeled chaise and a
one-horse chair; these he kept for two seasons. He next bought horses and
went to the coast for fish, which he conveyed to Leeds and Manchester. In
1745, when the rebellion broke out in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Scotland, he joined a regiment of
volunteers raised by Colonel Thornton, a patriotic gentleman, for the
defence of the House of Hanover. Metcalf shared with his comrades all the
dangers of the campaign. He was defeated at Falkirk, and victorious at
Culloden. He was the first to set up (in 1754) a stage-waggon between York
and Knaresborough, which he conducted himself twice a week in summer, and
once a week in winter. This employment he followed until he commenced
contracting for road-making. His first contract was for making three miles
of road between Minskip and Ferrensby. He afterwards erected bridges and
houses, and made hundreds of miles of roads in Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Cheshire, and Derbyshire. He was a dealer in timber and hay, of which he
measured and calculated the solid contents by a peculiar method of his
own. The hay he always measured with his arms, and, having learned the
height, he could tell the number of square yards in the stack. When he
went out, he always carried with him a stout staff some inches taller than
himself, which was of great service both in his travels and measurements.
In 1778 he lost his wife, after thirty-nine years of conjugal felicity, in
the sixty-first year of her age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> She was interred at Stockport. Four
years later he left Lancashire, and settled at the pleasant rural village
of Spofforth, not far distant from the town of his nativity. With a
daughter, he resided on a small farm until he died, in 1801. At the time
of his decease, his descendants were four children, twenty grandchildren,
and ninety great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Yorkshire Longevity,&#8221; compiled by Mr. William Grainge, of Harrogate, a
most painstaking writer on local history, will be found an interesting
account of Henry Jenkins, a celebrated Yorkshireman. It is stated: &#8220;In the
year 1743, a monument was erected, by subscription, in Bolton churchyard,
to the memory of Jenkins: it consists of a square base of freestone, four
feet four inches on each side, by four feet six inches in height,
surmounted by a pyramid eleven feet high. On the east side is inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>In the church on a mural tablet of black marble, is inscribed the
following epitaph, composed by Dr. Thomas Chapman, Master of Magdalen
College, Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Blush not, marble,<br />

the memory of<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Jenkins</span>:<br />

in the duration,<br />

of his enjoyments;<br />
and,<br />
tho&#8217; the partial world<br />

with a patriarch&#8217;s health and length of days;<br />
to teach mistaken man,<br />
these blessings were entailed on temperance,<br />
or, a life of labour and a mind at ease.<br />
<br />
He lived to the amazing age of 169;<br />
was interred here, Dec. 6, (or 9,) 1670,<br />
and had this justice done to his memory 1743.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>This inscription is a proof that learned men, and masters of colleges, are
not always exempt from the infirmity of writing nonsense. Passing over the
modest request to the <i>black marble</i> not to blush, because, it may <i>feel</i>
itself degraded by bearing the name of the plebeian Jenkins, when it ought
only to have been appropriated to kings and nobles, we find but
questionable philosophy in this inappropriate composition.</p>

<p>The multitude of great events which took place during the lifetime of this
man are truly wonderful and astonishing. He lived under the rule of nine
sovereigns of England&mdash;Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary,
Elizabeth, James I., Charles I., Oliver Cromwell, and Charles II. He was
born when the Roman Catholic religion was established by law. He saw the
dissolution of the monasteries, and the faith of the nation changed;
Popery established a second time by Queen Mary; Protestantism restored by
Elizabeth; the Civil War between Charles and the Parliament begun and
ended; Monarchy abolished; the young Republic of England, arbiter of the
destinies of Europe; and the restoration of Monarchy under the libertine
Charles II. During his time, England was invaded by the Scotch; a
Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> King was slain, and a Scottish Queen beheaded in England; a King
of Spain and a King of Scotland were Kings in England; three Queens and
one King were beheaded in England in his days; and fire and plague alike
desolated London. His lifetime time appears like that of a nation, more
than an individual, so long was it extended and so crowded was it with
such great events.</p>

<p>The foregoing many incidents remind us of the well-known Scottish epitaph
on Margery Scott, who died February 26th, 1728, at Dunkeld, at the extreme
age of one hundred years. According to Chambers&#8217;s &#8220;Domestic Annals of
Scotland,&#8221; the following epitaph was composed for her by Alexander
Pennecuik, but never inscribed, and it has been preserved by the reverend
statist of the parish, as a whimsical statement of historical facts
comprehended within the life of an individual:&mdash;</p>

occurred is so called from an Amazonian Scottish woman, who is reported,
by tradition, to have distinguished herself in the fight. An inscription
which was placed on her tombstone was legible within the present century,

following particulars: &#8220;His coffin, in which there was a great difficulty
to place him, was six feet four inches long, four feet four inches wide,
and two feet four inches deep; the immense substance of his legs made it
necessarily a square case. This coffin, which consisted of 112 superficial
feet of elm, was built on two axle-trees, and four cog-wheels. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> these
his remains were rolled into his grave, which was in the new burial-ground

it for some distance. It was found necessary to take down the window and
wall of the room in which he lay to allow of his being taken away.&#8221;</p>

mentions Miss Biffin. &#8220;She was found,&#8221; says Mr. Morley, &#8220;in the Fair, and
assisted by the Earl of Morton, who sat for his likeness to her, always
taking the unfinished picture away with him when he left, that he might
prove it to be all the work of her own shoulder. When it was done he laid
it before George III., in the year 1808; he obtained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> King&#8217;s favour
for Miss Biffin; and caused her to receive, at his own expense, further
instruction in her art from Mr. Craig. For the last twelve years of his
life he maintained a correspondence with her; and, after having enjoyed
favour from two King Georges, she received from William IV. a small
pension, with which, at the Earl&#8217;s request, she retired from a life among
caravans. But fourteen years later, having been married in the interval,
she found it necessary to resume, as Mrs. Wright, late Miss Biffin, her
business as a skilful miniature painter, in one or two of our chief
provincial towns.&#8221;</p>

admirable for the product of his genius, as unhappy in the rewards of
them. His satire, exposing the hypocrisy and wickedness of the rebels,
is such an inimitable piece, that, as he was the first, he may be said

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>This eccentric gentleman was possessed of considerable property, and was a
native of Gloucestershire. His grave and coffin were made under his
directions more than a twelvemonth before his death; the inscription on
the tablet on his coffin, and the lines placed upon his gravestone, were
his own composition. He gave all necessary orders for the conducting of
his funeral, and five shillings were wrapped in separate pieces of paper
for each of the bearers. The coffin was of singular beauty and neatness in
workmanship, and looked more like a piece of tasteful cabinet-work
intended for a drawing-room, than a receptacle for the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the great door of the Abbey of St. Peter, Gloucester, says Mr. Henry
Calvert Appleby, at the bottom of the body of the building, is a marble
monument to John Jones, dressed in the robes of an alderman, painted in
different colours. Underneath the effigy, on a tablet of black marble, are
the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">John Jones</span>, alderman, thrice mayor of the city, burgess of the
Parliament at the time of the gunpowder treason; registrar to eight
several Bishops of this diocese.</p></div>

<p>He died in the sixth year of the reign of King Charles I., on the first of
June, 1630. He gave orders for his monument to be raised in his lifetime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
When the workmen had fixed it up, he found fault with it, remarking that
the <i>nose was too red</i>. While they were altering it, he walked up and down
the body of the church. He then said that he had himself almost finished,
so he paid off the men, and died the next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>&#8220;This singular epitaph points out the last resting-place of Henry Marten,
one of the judges who condemned King Charles I. to the scaffold. On the
Restoration, Marten was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment, Chepstow
Castle being selected as the place of his incarceration. There he died in
1680, in the twenty-eighth year of his captivity, and seventy-eighth of
his age. He was originally interred in the chancel of the church; but a
subsequent vicar of Chepstow, Chest by name, who carried his petty party
animosities even beyond the grave, had the dead man&#8217;s dust removed,
averring that he would not allow the body of a regicide to lie so near the
altar. And so it was that Marten&#8217;s memorial came to occupy its present
position in the passage leading from the nave to the north aisle. We are
told that one Mr. Downton, a son-in-law of this pusillanimous parson,
touched to the quick by his relative&#8217;s harsh treatment of poor Marten&#8217;s
inanimate remains, retorted by writing this satirical epitaph for the Rev.
Mr. Chest&#8217;s tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>&#8220;Some doubt has been thrown on the probability of a man of Marten&#8217;s
culture having written, as is implied in the inscription, the epitaph
which has a place on his memorial.</p>

<p>&#8220;The regicide was a son of Sir Henry Marten, a favourite of the first
James, and by him appointed Principal Judge of the Admiralty and Dean of
Arches. Young Henry was himself a prominent person during the period of
the disastrous Civil War, and was elected Member of Parliament for
Berkshire in 1640. He was, in politics, a decided Republican, and threw in
his lot with the Roundhead followers of sturdy Oliver. When the tide of
popular favour turned in Charles II.&#8217;s direction, and Royalty was
reinstated, Marten and the rest of the regicides were brought to judgment
for signing the death warrant of their monarch. The consequence, in
Marten&#8217;s case, was life-long imprisonment, as we have seen, in Chepstow
Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Paterson, better known as &#8220;Old Mortality,&#8221; rests in the churchyard
of Caerlaverock, Dumfriesshire. We learn from Dr. Charles Rogers&#8217;s
&#8220;Monuments and Monumental Inscriptions in Scotland&#8221; (1871) that Paterson
was born in 1715, and was the youngest son of Walter Paterson and Margaret
Scott, who rented the farm of Haggista, parish of Hawick. He some time
served an elder brother who had a farm in Comcockle-muir, near Lochmaben.
He married Elizabeth Gray, who, having been cook in the family of Sir
Thomas Kirkpatrick, of Closeburn, procured for him an advantageous lease
of a freestone quarry at Morton. Here he resided many years, labouring
with exemplary diligence. From his youth attached to the sect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Cameronians, he evinced a deep interest in the memory of those who had
suffered in the cause of Presbytery. Occasionally he restored their
tombstones. At length his zeal in the restoration of these stony memorials
acquired the force of a passion. In 1758 he began to travel from parish to
parish, ever working with hammer and chisel in renewing the epitaphs of
the martyrs. His self-imposed task no entreaties of wife or children could
induce him to abandon. Though reduced to the verge of poverty, he
persisted in his labours till the last day of his existence. He died at
Banpend village, near Lockerbie, on the 29th January, 1801, aged
eighty-six. At his death he was found possessed of twenty-seven shillings
and sixpence, which were applied to the expenses of his funeral. Sir
Walter Scott, who has made &#8220;Old Mortality&#8221; the subject of a novel,
intended to rear a tombstone to his memory, but was unable to discover his
place of sepulture. Since the discovery has been made, Messrs. Black, of
Edinburgh, who possess the copyright of the Waverley novels, have reared
at the grave of the old enthusiast a suitable memorial stone. It is thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the adventures of Selkirk suggested to
Daniel Defoe the attractive story of &#8220;Robinson Crusoe.&#8221; In the &#8220;Dictionary

important information bearing on this subject.</p>

<p>In <i>Gloucester Notes and Queries</i> we read as follows: &#8220;Stout&#8217;s Hill is the
name of a house situated on high ground to the south of the village of
Uley, built in the style which, in the last century, was intended for
Gothic, but which may be more exactly defined as the &#8216;Strawberry Hill&#8217;
style. In a house of earlier date lived the father of Samuel Rudder, the
laborious compiler of the &#8216;History of Gloucestershire&#8217; (1779). He lies in
the churchyard of Uley, on the south side of the chancel, and his
gravestone has a brass-plate inserted, which records a remarkable fact:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Underneath lies the remains of <span class="smcap">Roger Rutter</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Rudder</span>, eldest

his long life.</p></div>

<p>Tradition tells us that this vegetarian lived mainly on &#8216;dump,&#8217; in various
forms. Usually he ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> &#8216;plain dump;&#8217; when tired of plain dump, he changed
his diet to &#8216;hard dump;&#8217; and when he was in a special state of
exhilaration, he added the variety &#8216;apple dump&#8217; to his very moderate
fare.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 2nd May, 1800, the remains of William Cowper were
interred in that part of Dereham Church known as St. Edmund&#8217;s Chapel. He
died without a will, but Lady Hesketh consented to administer his estate,
and eventually placed a tablet to his memory on the wall of the chancel,
near his grave. It is constructed of white marble, and over the top are
represented two volumes, labelled respectively &#8220;Holy Bible&#8221; and &#8220;The

<p>For some years we have been interested in the life and poetry of Mary
Pyper, &#8220;A Poet of the Poor,&#8221; and in our &#8220;Literary Byways&#8221; have told at
length the story of her career. We there state, through the exertions of
Dr. Rogers in May, 1885, a handsome cross was erected over her remains in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Greyfriars&#8217; churchyard, Edinburgh, simply bearing her name, &#8220;Mary Pyper.&#8221;
Such was the information we received from a friend whom we induced to see
the memorial and give us particulars of it, and to our surprise when we
visited her grave in April, 1899, we found on the cross the following
inscription, which we presume has been added since its erection:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among self-taught poets Mary Pyper is entitled to an honourable place.</p>

<p>Mr. John T. Page furnishes us with the following inscriptions copied from
Hogarth&#8217;s monument in Chiswick churchyard. It was erected, says Mr. Page,
in 1771, seven years after his death, and is a tall piece of masonry
crowned with a funeral urn. Beneath this, on the side facing the church,
are carved in low relief a mask, maul-stick, palette and brushes, a laurel
wreath and an open book bearing the title of his famous &#8220;Analysis of
Beauty.&#8221; On the same side, on a small block of Aberdeen granite at the
foot of the memorial, is recorded the fact that it was</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

<span class="smcap">William Hogarth</span>,<br />

<p>It has well stood the &#8220;storm and stress&#8221; since then, but is now beginning
to show signs of the need of another restoration, for, on the east side,
over the inscription, the combined armorial bearings of Hogarth and his
wife are as nearly as possible obliterated.</p>

<p>The lapse of one hundred and thirty years, says Mr. Page, has not served
to dim the ardour with which the works of William Hogarth are cherished by
the English nation. His &#8220;Harlot&#8217;s Progress&#8221; not only served to reconcile
his father-in-law, Sir James Thornhill, to the runaway match the plebeian
Hogarth had contracted three years before with his daughter, but it is
still looked upon as his <i>chef d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> by many eminent critics; and
there is nearly always to be seen a crowd round his &#8220;Marriage a la Mode&#8221;
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> National Gallery. The virulent contest with Wilkes and Churchill,
with which his last days were embittered, has long ago been forgotten, and
the name of William Hogarth still lives, and will be popular for all time
through his admired series of paintings and engravings, which are prized
and hoarded with an ever-increasing love by their happy possessors.</p>

an interesting sketch of the career of William Etty, the son of a miller,
who for seven years was an apprentice to a printer in Hull, but devoted
all his spare time to art, and eventually after many struggles won a high
place amongst the painters of the period. He was buried in the churchyard
of St. Olave, York, where from the beautiful grounds of the Yorkshire
Philosophical Society, and through one of the arches of the ruined Abbey
of St. Mary, his tomb may be seen. The arch near his grave was closed, but
was opened to bring in sight his tomb. Mr. Fairholt is in error in saying
it bears the simple inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">William Etty, Royal Academician.</span></p>

<p>Etty, says Fairholt, had that wisdom which few men possess, the wisdom of
a contented mind. He loved his quiet home, in his provincial birthplace,
better than the bustle of London, or the notoriety he might obtain by a
residence there. His character and his talent would ensure him attention
and deference anywhere, but he preferred his own nook by the old church at
York. He probably felt with the poet, that</p>

<p>A sketch of his life has been written by Walter Hamilton, under the title
of &#8220;George Cruikshank, Artist and Humourist.&#8221; (London: Elliot Stock,
1878.) William Bates, <span class="smcaplc">B.A.</span>, <span class="smcaplc">M.R.C.S.</span>, wrote &#8220;George Cruikshank, the
Artist, the Humourist, and the Man, with Some Account of his Brother
Robert.&#8221; (Birmingham: Houghton &amp; Hammond, 1878.) Blanchard Jerrold wrote
&#8220;The Life of George Cruikshank.&#8221; (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, a new edition
with eighty-four illustrations, 1883.) An able article contributed to the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, by William Makepeace Thackeray, has been reproduced
in book form by George Redway, London (1884). Some time ago the following
appeared in a newspaper:&mdash;One day while Dr. B. W. Richardson was engaged
at his house with an old patient who had been away many years in India,
George Cruikshank&#8217;s card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> was handed to the doctor. &#8220;It must be the
grandson, or the son, at any rate, of the great artist I remember as a
boy,&#8221; said the patient. &#8220;It is impossible that George Cruikshank of Queen
Caroline&#8217;s trial-time can be alive!&#8221; The doctor asked the vivacious George
to come in. He tripped in, in his eighty-fourth year, and, when the old
officer expressed his astonishment, George exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you
whether he is alive!&#8221; With this he took the poker and tongs from the
grate, laid them upon the carpet, and executed the sword dance before Dr.
Richardson&#8217;s astonished patient.</p>

<p>At the east end of the High Street, Portsmouth, and nearly opposite the
house before which the Duke of Buckingham was stabbed by Felton, in 1628,
stands the Unitarian Chapel. John Pounds habitually worshipped here on a
Sunday evening, and the place where he used to sit, in front of one of the
side galleries, just to the right of the minister, is still pointed out.
He lies buried in the graveyard, on the left-hand side of the chapel, near
the end of the little foot-path which leads round the building to the
vestries. Shortly after his death a tablet was placed in the chapel,
beneath the gallery, to his memory. Although his grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> was dug as near as
possible to that part of the chapel wall opposite where he used to sit,
yet this tablet was, apparently without any reason, put some distance away
from the spot. In shape and material it is of the usual orthodox style&mdash;a
square slab of white marble, edged with black, and inscribed on it are the
words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Erected by friends<br />
as a memorial of their esteem<br />
and respect for<br />
<span class="smcap">John Pounds</span>,<br />
who, while earning his livelihood<br />
by mending shoes, gratuitously<br />
educated, and in part clothed and fed,<br />
some hundreds of poor children.<br />
He died suddenly<br />
on the 1st of January, 1839,<br />
aged 72 years.<br />
Thou shalt be blessed: for they<br />
cannot recompense thee.</p>

<p>Not long after this tablet was placed in position the idea was mooted that
a monument should be erected over his grave. The Rev. Henry Hawkes, the
minister who then had charge of the place, at once took the matter up, and
subscriptions came in so well that the monument was more than paid for.

<p>The writer of the foregoing epitaph was Dr. Booker, vicar of Dudley. The
inscription is associated with one of the most remarkable trials of the
present century. It will not be without interest to furnish a few notes on
the case. One Abraham Thornton was tried at the Warwick Assizes for the
murder of Mary Ashford, and acquitted. The brother and next of kin of the
deceased, not being satisfied with the verdict, sued out, as the law
allowed him, an appeal against Thornton, by which he could be put on his
trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> again. The law allowed the appeal in case of murder, and it also
gave option to the accused of having it tried by wager of law or by wager
of battle. The brother of the unfortunate woman had taken no account of
this, and accordingly, not only Mr. Ashford but the judge, jury, and bar
were taken greatly aback, and stricken with dismay, when the accused,
being requested to plead, took a paper from Mr. Reader, his counsel, and a
pair of gloves, one of which he drew on, and, throwing the other on the
ground, exclaimed, &#8220;Not guilty; and I am ready to defend the same with my
body!&#8221; Lord Ellenborough on the bench appeared grave, and the accuser
looked amazed, so the court was adjourned to enable the judge to have an
opportunity of conferring with his learned brethren. After several
adjournments, Lord Ellenborough at last declared solemnly, but
reluctantly, that wager of battle was still the law of the land, and that
the accused had a right of appeal to it. To get rid of the law an attempt
was made, by passing a short and speedy Act of Parliament, but this was
ruled impossible, as it would have been <i>ex post facto</i>, and people waited
curiously to see the lists set up in the Tothill Fields. As Mr. Ashford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
refused to meet Thornton, he was obliged to cry &#8220;craven!&#8221; After that the
appellor was allowed to go at large, and he could not be again tried by
wager of law after having claimed his wager of battle. In 1819 an Act was
passed to prevent any further appeals for wager of battle.</p>

suddenly of excitement on hearing Shrewsbury bells ring for the accession

<p>Mr. J. Potter Briscoe favours us with an account of a Nottingham
character, and a copy of his epitaph. Vincent Eyre was by trade a
needle-maker, and was a firm and consistent Tory in politics, taking an
active interest in all the party struggles of the period. His good nature
and honesty made him popular among the poorer classes, with whom he
chiefly associated. A commendable trait in his character is worthy of
special mention, namely, that, notwithstanding frequent temptations, he
spurned to take a bribe from anyone. In the year 1727 an election for a
Member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> Parliament took place, and all the ardour of Vin&#8217;s nature was
at once aroused in the interests of his favourite party. The Tory
candidate, Mr. Borlase Warren, was opposed by Mr. John Plumtree, the Whig
nominee, and, in the heat of the excitement, Vin emphatically declared
that he should not mind dying immediately if the Tories gained the
victory. Strange to relate, such an event actually occurred, for when the
contest and the &#8220;chairing&#8221; of the victor was over, he fell down dead with
joy, September 6th, 1727. The epitaph upon him is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Next we deal with an instance of pure affection. The churchyard of the
Yorkshire village of Bowes contains the grave of two lovers, whose
touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> fate suggested Mallet&#8217;s beautiful ballad of &#8220;Edwin and Emma.&#8221;
The real names of the couple were Rodger Wrightson and Martha Railton. The
story is rendered with no less accuracy than pathos by the poet:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fast by a sheltering wood,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A soul devoid of art;</span><br />
And from whose eyes, serenely mild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone forth the feeling heart.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>We are told that Edwin&#8217;s father and sister were bitterly opposed to their
love. The poor youth pined away. When he was dying Emma was permitted to
see him, but the cruel sister would scarcely allow her to bid him a word
of farewell. Returning home, she heard the passing bell toll for the death
of her lover&mdash;</p>

<p>The lovers were buried the same day and in the same grave. In the year
1848, Dr. F. Dinsdale, <span class="smcaplc">F.S.A.</span>, editor of the &#8220;Ballads and Songs of David
Mallet,&#8221; etc., erected a simple but tasteful monument to the memory of the
lovers, bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Rodger Wrightson</span>, junr., and <span class="smcap">Martha Railton</span>, both of Bowes; buried in

she cry&#8217;d out My heart is broken and in a few hours expired, purely
thro&#8217; love, March 15, 1714-15. Such is the brief and touching record
contained in the parish register of burials. It has been handed down
by unvarying tradition that the grave was at the west end of the
church, directly beneath the bells. The sad history of these true and
faithful lovers forms the subject of Mallet&#8217;s pathetic ballad of

<p>In St. Peter&#8217;s churchyard, Barton-on-Humber, there is a tombstone with the

<p>As may be inferred, no name is given; the date is 1777. A curious and
romantic legend attaches to the epitaph. In the above year an unknown lady
of great beauty, who is conjectured to have loved &#8220;not wisely, but too
well,&#8221; came to reside in the town. She was accompanied by a gentleman, who
left her after making lavish arrangements for her comfort. She was proudly
reserved in her manners, frequently took long solitary walks, and
studiously avoided all intercourse. In giving birth to a child she died,
and did not disclose her name or family connections. After her decease,
the gentleman who came with her arrived, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> overwhelmed with grief
at the intelligence which awaited him. He took the child away without
unravelling the secret, having first ordered the stone to be erected, and
delivered into the mason&#8217;s hands the verse, which is at once a mystery and
a memento. Such are the particulars gathered from &#8220;The Social History and
Antiquities of Barton-on-Humber,&#8221; by H. W. Ball, issued in 1856. Since the
publication of Mr. Ball&#8217;s book, we have received from him the following
notes, which mar somewhat the romantic story as above related. We are
informed that the person referred to in the epitaph was the wife of a man
named Jonathan Burkitt, who came from the neighbourhood of Grantham. He
had been <i>valet de chambre</i> to some gentleman or nobleman, who gave him a
large sum of money on his marrying the lady. They came to reside at
Barton, where she died in childbirth. Burkitt, after the death of his
wife, left the town, taking the infant (a boy), who survived. In about
three years he returned, and married a Miss Ostler, daughter of an
apothecary at Barton. He there kept the &#8220;King&#8217;s Head,&#8221; a public-house at
that time. The man got through about &pound;2,000 between leaving Grantham and
marrying his second wife.</p>

inquiry, invariably raises curiosity respecting it:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the accomplishment of this resolution, the three kingdoms lie
under no small debt of gratitude to the Covenanters. They suffered and
bled both in fields and on scaffolds for the cause of civil and
religious liberty; and shall we reap the fruit of their sufferings,
their prayers and their blood, and yet treat their memory either with
indifference or scorn? No! whatever minor faults may be laid to their
charge, whatever trivial accusations may be brought against them, it
cannot be but acknowledged that they were the men who, &#8220;singly and
alone,&#8221; stood forward in defence of Scotland&#8217;s dearest rights, and to
whom we at the present day owe everything that is valuable to us
either as men or as Christians.</p></div>

<p>It is an easy matter to arrange words forming a simple sentence in English
to appear like Latin. This was successfully done in 1796, when a print was
published under the title of &#8220;The Puzzle.&#8221; &#8220;This curious inscription is
humbly dedicated,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;to the penetrating geniuses of
Oxford, Cambridge, Eton, and the learned Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> of Antiquaries.&#8221; The
words have every appearance of a Latin inscription, but if the stops and
capital letters or division of the words are disregarded, the epitaph may
easily be read as follows:&mdash;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
